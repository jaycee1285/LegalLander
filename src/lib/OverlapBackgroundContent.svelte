              It’s easier to think about dreams and future memories than a lot of ugly realities about life. It’s certainly easier than it is to try and talk about them with other people. LegacyPath is the secure, private way to help chart the next steps of your journey that focuses on futures not endings.</p>

              If you already have a trusted advisor, that’s great. But it can be hard to open up to professionals about what kind of dress we imagine our granddaughter wearing to prom. Or a fear that our son might not remember how to tie our grandson’s bowtie at a future wedding.</p>

                  Instead, you can work with a non-judgmental partner to outline what dreams you have for your loved ones. Then you can start to examine what ways you can help them prepare for those next steps now and in the future. At the end you’ll have a plan that you can take to the financial or legal advisor of your choice.</p>
